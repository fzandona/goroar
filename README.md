[Roaring Bitmaps](http://roaringbitmap.org) implemented in Go. Very initial drop, mostly a simple port of the Java implementation at this point.

**TODO**

* Bitwise XOR, NOT, andNot (in-place)
* Immutable bitwise operations
* Serialization
* Move to idiomatic Go 
* Test re-factoring & benchmarking
